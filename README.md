# Autoclicker-C-
A very fast auto-clicker made in C++.
Its starts clicking once you press c, and stops when you release.

Download the auto_clicker/Release/auto_clicker.exe executable if you only want the auto-clicket itself. 

Its extremely minimalistic code that does the strict necessary and nothing more to be as performant as possible.
You can easily reach thousands of cps with that.

Unlimited autoclicker is essentially the same as the other one, except you don't select the number of cps,
since it is just capped at whatever your computer can endure.

I do not recommend using it, as I do not see a situation in which you would need more than a thousand cps.

Even on the other one, avoid setting a number of cps above maybe a 100,
as it will most likely crash whatever you are clicking on.
